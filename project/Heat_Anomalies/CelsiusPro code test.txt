The overall goal of this coding test is to compute a heat index of your choice at a given administrative level. We do recommend to using gridded weather data as underlying (e..g., E-OBS http://www.ecad.eu/download/ensembles/download.php or similar). The spatial aggregation can be performed for any administration level and region of your choice. Publicly available shapefiles (most probably needed for the spatial aggregation) can be found here (http://www.gadm.org/). The weather index of your choice (quickly check the scientific literature beforehand) must reflect the seasonal severity of heat. We ask you to test the time series for possible trends and, if the latter are found, use a detrending method to produce a new time series. Use the detrended time series to calculate seasonal/annual heat anomalies.
